 What our program can do:

 2. Draw Text: Click on draw text button, select color, click on screen to pick location for text, input text.
 3. Draw Line: Click on draw Lines button, select color, drag, and create lines.

  	ii. text: click on text to change color and change text
  	iii. line: not working properly
  	iv. circle: click and change color
 5. Move: Click on the object and click to the chosen location on screen to change location. Apply to text, box,and circle.
 6. Remove: Click on the object to remove from screen. 
 7. Clear: Click on the button and all the objects on screen will be removed.
 8. Redraw: Recall all objects that have been added to the arraylist.
 
 For the code:
 1.Create a Shape interface that share draw method & accessors with other classes.
 2.Create Box, Circle, Line, Text that implementing shape interface.
 3.In user interface, we create an arrayList of Shape to store all objects that we create,
 multiple method (mode) for drawBox, drawText, drawLine, drawCircle, remove, modifies, and move.
 4.We create a doMouse method that encapsulate "released" and "pressed " actions. 
 5. Within each of the actions, we create if loops for each mode.
 6.Within the modifyDrawing mode loop, the MoveDrawing mode loop and the RemoveDrawing mode loop, we create a for
 loop that iterate through the arrayList of shape and check whether the mouse pressed is within the area of the 
 objects on screen. if found, modify, move or remove.
 
 Van Le, Martin Jose, and Pui Li (me) did the group assignment together on the first 2 day. We experienced difficulty on 
discussing the projects virtually, and we can't contact Martin on the third day.
